免疫学第⼆次作业
main component of the innate immune system
Stage Time scale 
(approx.)Key components Receptors & 
signalsCellular events Effectors Assays & markers Writing focus (what to 
emphasize)
Barrier defenses Continuous 
/ immediateSkin, mucosal 
epithelium, normal 
microbiota, 
lysozyme, 
antimicrobial 
peptidesPhysical / 
chemical 
blockingPrevent pathogen entry; 
maintain microbial balanceAntimicrobial 
peptides, lysozyme, 
acidic pHHistology , 
microbiology , pH 
testingDescribe the “first line of 
defense,” include one or two 
molecular examples
Recognition Minutes – 
hoursPRRs (TLRs, 
mannose receptor , 
scavenger receptor)PAMPs / 
DAMPs → 
MyD88 / TRIF 
→ NF-κBInitiation of transcription, 
production of pro-
inflammatory cytokinesTNF-α, IL-1, IFNs qPCR/ELISA, 
receptor knockout 
modelsEmphasize how PRRs detect 
exogenous/endogenous signals 
and activate downstream 
pathways
Soluble 
effectors 
(Complement / 
soluble factors)Minutes – 
hoursComplement 
proteins (C3, C5, 
etc.), acute-phase 
proteinsClassical / 
alternative / 
lectin pathwaysBacterial lysis, opsonization, 
chemoattractionC3b, C5a 
(chemoattractant)Complement 
activity assays, 
C3b labelingHighlight the role of complement 
in bridging phagocytosis and 
inflammation
Cellular effectors Hours – 
daysNeutrophils, 
macrophages, 
dendritic cells, NK 
cellsFcγR, 
complement 
receptors, TLRsNeutrophil extravasation 
and phagocytosis; 
macrophage phagocytosis 
and clearance; NK 
cytotoxicity 
(perforin/granzyme)ROS, RNS, perforin, 
granzymesFlow cytometry 
(Ly6G/CD1 1b, 
CD15/CD66), 
cytotoxicity assays, 
ROS probesWrite the chain of cellular actions 
(recruitment → recognition → 
killing → clearance) and note 
potential tissue damage/repair
Bridge to 
adaptive 
immunity1 – 3 days Dendritic cells, 
MHC I/II, 
costimulatory 
molecules 
(CD80/86)Antigen 
processing and 
presentation → 
TCR recognitionDC maturation and 
migration to lymph nodes; 
activation of naïve T cellsCostimulatory 
molecules, IL-12Lymph node cell 
analysis, T cell 
proliferation assaysStress how innate immunity 
provides information and 
costimulation for adaptive 
immunity
Resolution / 
repairDays – 
weeksAnti-inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-10, 
TGF-β), scavenger 
macrophagesDamage signals 
→ clearance of 
apoptotic cellsClearance of apoptotic cells, 
tissue repair , resolution of 
inflammationAnti-inflammatory 
cytokines, matrix 
metalloproteinasesHistology , cytokine 
profilingWrite about clearance/repair 
mechanisms, and mention that 
failure may lead to chronic 
inflammation
An example when E.coli is involved
