Components of blood（二）Blood Cells：isosmotic ≠ isotonic•Osmotic pressure itself is for semi-permeable membranes; however, cell membranes are not simply semi-permeable.•Isotonic solution: a solution that does not cause deformation of the erythrocyte membrane from a physiological point of view.•0.85% NaCl solution is an isosmotic, isotonic solution (NaCl does not pass freely through the cell membrane)•1.9% urea (not permeable to semi-permeable membrane) solution is isosmotic, but not isotonic (urea can freely pass through the cell membrane into the cell and cause erythrocyte hemolysis)
