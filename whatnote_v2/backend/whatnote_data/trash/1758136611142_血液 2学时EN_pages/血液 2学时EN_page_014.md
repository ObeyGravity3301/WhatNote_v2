Components of blood2、Physicochemical properties of plasma1) Osmotic pressure: the ability of solute molecules in solution to absorb water through a semi-permeable membrane(1) Proportional to the number of solute particles, independent of solute type and particle size.(2) Composition: Crystalloid Osmotic Pressure and Colloid Osmotic Pressure.①Crystalloid Osmotic Pressure: formation of crystalline substances (electrolytes) in plasma → maintenance of water balance inside and outside blood cells②Colloid osmotic pressure:Plasma protein (mainly albumin) formation → maintenance of intra- and extravascular water balance.
