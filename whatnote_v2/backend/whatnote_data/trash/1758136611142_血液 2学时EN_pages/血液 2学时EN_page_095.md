Mechanisms of organismal protection of bloodRh blood type systemRh-positive: D antigen on erythrocytes; 99% of our Han Chinese are Rh-positiveRh-negative: lack of D antigen on red blood cells; 1% of our Han Chinese population is Rh-negativeRh blood group characteristics: Anti-Rh antibodies are acquired through humoral immunity •Among Chinese Han Chinese, transfusion reactions caused by Rh blood group incompatibility are relatively less frequent than those caused by ABO blood groups;••the Rh blood group system is generally free of natural antibodies, so that Rh blood group incompatibility is not detected during the first transfusion;•However, Rh-negative recipients who receive Rh-positive blood may develop immune anti-Rh antibodies and may have hemolytic transfusion reactions if they receive Rh-positive blood again. ••If the Rh-negative mother has an Rh-positive fetus, the red blood cells of the fetus will enter the mother's body through the placenta and stimulate the mother to produce anti-Rh antibodies, which will then enter the fetus through the placenta; because the anti-Rh antibodies produced in the first pregnancy are very small, neonatal hemolytic disease rarely occurs;•The increase in anti-Rh antibodies produced by Rh-positive fetuses in the second pregnancy can lead to neonatal hemolytic disease;•If an Rh-negative pregnant woman has had a transfusion of Rh-positive blood, fetal hemolytic disease can occur even in the first pregnancy.
