The blood volume of a normal adult is about 7 to 8% of body weight (about 60 to 80 milliliters per kilogram of body weight).For a 60 kg body weight person, the blood volume is about 4200 to 4800 mlThis includes the circulating blood volume that flows rapidly in the cardiovascular system (which accounts for the majority of the volume) and the stored blood volume that is retained in the liver, spleen, lungs, vena cava, and subcutaneous venous plexus.Stored blood volume may be added to the circulating blood volume during strenuous exercise, blood loss, or emergency situations.Adequate blood supply for effective oxygenation and nourishmentAnimals of the same species,The robust, muscular ones have more blood volume than the lean ones.Males generally have more than females, but females have a significant increase in blood volume during gestation (especially at the end), dominated by an increase in plasma volume.
