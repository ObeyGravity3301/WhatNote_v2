Mechanisms of organismal protection of blood2）Blood loss•Blood volume variations are influenced by many factors. Normally, the variation is no more than 5 to 10%.•In healthy individuals, a single blood loss of no more than 10% of the total blood volume does not seriously affect normal physiological function. •Circulating blood volume is restored within 1-2 hours: stored blood volume + tissue fluid absorption•Plasma protein: recovery by liver synthesis within 1-2 days•Blood cells: recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis within 1 month•More than 20% → weakness, dysfunction of higher parts of the central nervous system. •Blood loss more than 30% → shock, severe dysfunction of the central nervous system, fatal if no emergency treatment.
