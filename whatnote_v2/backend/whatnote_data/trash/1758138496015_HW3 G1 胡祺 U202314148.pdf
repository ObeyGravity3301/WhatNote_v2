<p>Describe the basic process and typical event characteristics of T cell mediated adaptive immune response to one of the exogenous or endogenous antigens.</p>
<p>Typical Event: T Cell Role in Adaptive Immune Response to Viral Infection</p>
<p>When a virus infects host cells, viral proteins are degraded into short peptides and presented on the cell surface through MHC class I molecules. This process allows cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells to recognize the infected cells. Once activated, CD8⁺ T cells undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).</p>
<p>The effector CTLs bind specifically to infected cells via the T cell receptor (TCR)–MHC I–peptide complex. They then release perforin and granzymes, which induce apoptosis in the target cells, thereby eliminating the viral reservoir. In addition, CD4⁺ helper T cells play a supportive role by releasing cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. These cytokines promote the proliferation and survival of CD8⁺ T cells and enhance the overall immune response.</p>
<p>A critical feature of this adaptive immune response is the generation of memory T cells. After the clearance of infection, a portion of activated T cells persist as memory cells, which can rapidly respond to the same viral antigen upon reinfection. This long-lasting immunity represents one of the defining characteristics of the adaptive immune system.</p>
