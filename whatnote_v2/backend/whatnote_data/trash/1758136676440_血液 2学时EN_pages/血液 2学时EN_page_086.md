Mechanisms of organismal protection of blood（self-study）•If blood loss is one liter or less → Circulating blood volume decreases mildly → Blood pressure decreases mildly → Negative feedback stimulates increased cardiac muscle strength, increased heart rate, increased pumping, and vasoconstriction → Blood pressure rises again•Blood loss up to two liters → significant decrease in circulating blood volume → heart pumping ↓↓ → significant decrease in blood pressure → decrease in myocardial blood supply from coronary arteries → decrease in myocardial force → heart pumping ↓↓↓↓ → coronary blood flow continues to decrease → further impairment of heart function → vicious circle → until death•Effect of blood loss on cardiac pumping functionPositive feedback usually leads to system instability
