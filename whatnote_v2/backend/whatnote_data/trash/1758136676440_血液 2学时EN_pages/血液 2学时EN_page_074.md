Mechanisms of organismal protection of blood(understanding)4）Anticoagulation and fibrinolytic processes（2） Anticoagulant substances in body fluids· Antithrombin: a glycoprotein secreted by hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells as a serine protease inhibitor that binds to and inactivates factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa and the serine residues of the thrombin active center.· Heparin: an acidic mucopolysaccharide produced by mast cells and basophils~can bind to antithrombin and enhance its affinity for thrombin (↑100-fold) ~ stimulates the release of tissue factor inhibitors and other anticoagulant substances from vascular endothelial cells → inhibits the coagulation process· Protein C system:~hepatic synthesis, VK-dependent, present as zymogen, activated by thrombin + thrombin modulator~ Inactivates coagulation factors, enhances fibrinolysis, enhances antithrombin action
