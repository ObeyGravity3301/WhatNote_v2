Mechanisms of organismal protection of bloodThe basic process of physiological hemostasis: ①When small vessels are damaged, the injurious stimulus immediately causes local vasoconstriction, which can close the small vessels if the break is small.②Vascular injury exposes the subendothelial tissue, which activates platelets and the coagulation system in the plasma, while vasoconstriction suspends or slows blood flow, facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation, forming a loose hemostatic plug to fill the wound.③After the coagulation system is activated, the soluble fibrinogen in the plasma turns into insoluble fibrin multimers, forming a strong hemostatic plug composed of fibrin and platelets together, effectively stopping bleeding.
