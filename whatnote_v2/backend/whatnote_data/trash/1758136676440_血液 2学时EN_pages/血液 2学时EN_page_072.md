Mechanisms of organismal protection of bloodThe complete process of physiological hemostasis:Vascular, platelet, coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolytic system together①When small vessels are damaged, the injurious stimulus immediately causes local vasoconstriction, which can close the small vessels if the break is small.②Vascular injury exposes the subendothelial tissue, which activates platelets and the coagulation system in the plasma, while vasoconstriction suspends or slows blood flow, facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation, forming a loose hemostatic plug to fill the wound.③When the coagulation system is activated, the soluble fibrinogen in plasma is converted into insoluble fibrin multimers, forming a strong hemostatic plug composed of fibrin and platelets, which effectively stops bleeding.④The activation of anticoagulation and fibrinolytic processes in the plasma prevents the increasing size of the clot and the spread of the clotting process beyond the local area; and gradually dissolves the clot as the vascular repair process proceeds.
