Mechanisms of organismal protection of blood（self-study）4）Anticoagulation and fibrinolytic processes（3） Factors affecting blood clotting in in vitro operationsAccelerate: warming, increase roughnessin traumaDelay: cooling, anticoagulant (EDTA, sodium citrate)•Warm saline-soaked gauze or gelatin sponge compression of wounds is commonly used in surgery to stop bleeding, which is to use the rough surface to accelerate factor Ⅻ activation and platelet adhesion and aggregation; using warmth to increase enzyme activity and the speed of enzymatic reaction to accelerate the coagulation process and facilitate hemostasis.•Preoperative injection of vitamin K in surgical patients can promote the synthesis of coagulation factors by the liver and reduce intraoperative bleeding.•In clinical blood tests and transfusions, anticoagulants must be added to the drawn blood and stored at low temperature to avoid blood clotting. During blood transfusion, sodium citrate is commonly used as anticoagulant; during transfusion, in order to keep the deep vein open, heparin solution will be taken for positive pressure sealing when maintaining the deep vein pipeline.
